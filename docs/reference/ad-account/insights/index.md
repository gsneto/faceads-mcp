# Ad Account, Insights

[](#)

The Insights API can return several metrics which are _estimated_ or _in-development_. In some cases a metric may be **both** _estimated and in-development_.

-   **Estimated** - Provide directional insights for outcomes that are hard to precisely quantify. They may evolve as we gather more data. See [Ads Help Center, Estimated metrics](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/181058782494426?helpref=faq_content#estimated).
    
-   **In Development** - Still being tested and may change as we improve our methodologies. We encourage you to use it for directional guidance, but please use caution when using it for historical comparisons or strategic planning. See [Ads Help Center, In development metrics](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/181058782494426?helpref=faq_content#indevelopment).
    

For more information, see [Insights API, Estimated and Deprecated Metrics](/docs/marketing-api/insights/estimated-in-development)

Facebook will no longer be able to aggregate non-inline conversion metric values across iOS 14.5 and non-iOS 14.5 campaigns due to differences in attribution logic. Querying across iOS 14.5 and non-iOS 14.5 campaigns will result in no data getting returned for non-inline conversion metrics such as app installs and purchases. Inline event metrics like impressions, link clicks, and video views, however, can still be aggregated. Please visit our [changelog](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/changelog/non-versioned-changes/jan-19-2021) for more information.

O parâmetro `date_preset = lifetime` foi desativado na Graph API v10.0 e substituído por `date_preset = maximum`, que retorna um máximo de 37 meses de dados. Para a v9.0 e versões anteriores, `date_preset = maximum` será ativado em 25 de maio de 2021, e todas as chamadas de `lifetime` serão definidas como `maximum` por padrão e retornarão somente 37 meses de dados.

Parâmetro

Descrição

`action_attribution_windows`

list<enum{1d\_view, 7d\_view, 28d\_view, 1d\_click, 7d\_click, 28d\_click, 1d\_ev, dda, default, 7d\_view\_first\_conversion, 28d\_view\_first\_conversion, 7d\_view\_all\_conversions, 28d\_view\_all\_conversions, skan\_view, skan\_click, skan\_click\_second\_postback, skan\_view\_second\_postback, skan\_click\_third\_postback, skan\_view\_third\_postback}>

Valor padrão: `default`

The attribution window for the actions.  
For example, `28d_click` means the API returns all actions that happened 28 days after someone clicked on the ad. `1d_ev` refers to engaged-view conversions counted when a skippable video ad is played for at least 10 seconds, or for at least 97% of its total length if it’s shorter than 10 seconds, and a person takes an action within 1 day.  
The `default` option means `["7d_click","1d_view"]`.

`action_breakdowns`

enum{impression, conversion, mixed, lifetime}

Determines the report time of action stats. For example, if a person saw the ad on Jan 1st but converted on Jan 2nd, when you query the API with `action_report_time=impression`, you see a conversion on Jan 1st.
